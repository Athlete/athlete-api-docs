A very simple interface has been made to allow allow you to see how the interface works
easily without writing any code. This can be useful so you can visually see how the
API works, inspect responses, do ad-hoc testing, etc. By using a developer console like
Firebug or Chrome's Developer tools, you can watch the requests and responses to see
what's going to behind the scenes.
